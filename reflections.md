# Reflection on Development Tools

## The Terminal

The **terminal** is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with a computer through text commands. It can pervide shorter ways of doing things. It can save steps.

### What I Learned
- Basic command-line navigation (`cd`, `ls`, `mkdir`, etc.).


### Why It Matters
Understanding the terminal is crucial for developers because:
- Many development tools and frameworks are configured through the command line.
- It enables efficient automation of tasks through scripting.
- Remote servers and cloud services are often accessed via the command line.

## Git and GitHub

**Git** is a distributed version control system that helps track changes in source code during software development. **GitHub** is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories and collaborative tools.

### What I Learned
- The basics of Git version control: add, commit, push, pull, and merge.
- Branching and merging strategies for collaborative development.
- Using GitHub for remote repository hosting, collaboration, and issue tracking.
- How to use the terminal to make changes. Then also send it to VSCode and how to you the commit there. 

### Why It Matters
- **Version Control**: Git allows tracking changes, reverting to previous states, and collaboration without conflicts.
- **Collaboration**: GitHub facilitates teamwork, code reviews, and project management.

## Anticipated Impact as a Developer

Understanding and mastering these tools can greatly benefit a developer:

- **Efficient Workflow**: The terminal streamlines tasks and improves productivity.
- **Collaboration**: Git and GitHub enable seamless collaboration, making it easier for teams to work together.
- **Version Control**: Avoiding version conflicts and tracking changes helps maintain a clean and reliable codebase.
- **Community Involvement**: GitHub's social features open doors to contributions, feedback, and learning from others.
